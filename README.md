# ü©∫ Predictive Modeling for Clinical Outcomes

An interpretable, data-driven framework for **early prediction of hypotension** in patient monitoring data, combining both **supervised** and **unsupervised** machine learning.

## üéØ Project Overview

The goal of this project was to build an **interpretable and data-driven framework** for predicting hypotension events in clinical time-series data using both supervised and unsupervised learning.  
We designed a pipeline that transforms raw minute-by-minute vital signs into **structured 2-hour windows**, extracts physiological and trend-based features, and trains an **XGBoost early-warning model** capable of predicting hypotension up to two hours in advance.

## üß† Model Development and Interpretability

The model achieved meaningful predictive performance and, through its internal learning process, **identified physiologically relevant features‚Äîsuch as the latest mean arterial pressure (MAP), oxygen saturation (SpO‚ÇÇ), and temperature‚Äîas the most influential predictors**, showing that it **quantitatively learned which variables mattered most** for risk estimation.

## üîç Pattern Discovery via Unsupervised Learning

Beyond prediction, **unsupervised UMAP and KMeans analyses revealed distinct clusters of patient states**, where high-risk windows naturally grouped together, indicating that the learned feature space captures **latent physiological patterns associated with deterioration**.  
Overall, the project demonstrates a **complete and explainable pipeline for clinical outcome prediction**, combining temporal modeling, feature interpretability, and pattern discovery.
