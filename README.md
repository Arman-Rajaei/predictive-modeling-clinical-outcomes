# 🧠 Predictive Modeling for Clinical Outcomes

This project builds a complete machine-learning pipeline to model ICU-like multivariate time-series.
It combines:
- 🩺  Feature-based supervised learning for early-warning prediction  
- ⏱️  Time-series forecasting of vital signs  
- 🔍  Unsupervised clustering and state discovery  

## Project Goals
- Generate or load multivariate patient monitoring data
- Engineer temporal and statistical features
- Train interpretable predictive models
- Visualize latent physiological states (UMAP + KMeans)
